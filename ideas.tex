Need to use sine and cosine curves to removal the seasonality of the data.


Notation station:

Let $x_i^j$ be the jth value from feature i.


Z(s,t) 
    
If it were linear it would look something like this:  
$$\mathbf{y_j} = \beta_0 + \mathbf{x}_1^j\beta_1 + \mathbf{x}_2^j\beta_2+ ... + \mathbf{x}_n^j\beta_n + \epsilon $$

where $x_i$ is the ith feature

Or if we use Einstein summation notation:

$$\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{x}_i\beta_i + \beta_0 + \epsilon $$

Potentially Gaussian Regression for historical data at all locations, then use kriging to generate a more accurate version considering spatial data.
